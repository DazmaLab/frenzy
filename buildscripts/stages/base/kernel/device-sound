# The flags of the device tells the device a bit more info about the
# device that normally is obtained through the PnP interface.
#	bit  2..0   secondary DMA channel;
#	bit  4      set if the board uses two dma channels;
#	bit 15..8   board type, overrides autodetection; leave it
#		    zero if don't know what to put in (and you don't,
#		    since this is unsupported at the moment...).
